            <p>In the last weeks and months we have had over a thousand people take a look at our Alpha version. Many of you have given us important feedback on how you would like to use Whiteout Mail to protect your private communication and what we should be working on in the future. A big thank you to all of you who have gotten in touch!</p>

<h3 id="nowinbeta">Now in Beta!</h3>

<p>With the most recent release we are upgrading to Beta status. We feel that the feature set as well as stability and performance are now where they need to be for production use. We use it every day and we hope that you will too. And we will make it better all the time, with frequent updates every two weeks.</p>

<p>To celebrate today's beta release, we are also launching a complete redesign of the <a href="https://whiteout.io">whiteout.io homepage</a>.</p>

<h3 id="whatsnew">What’s New</h3>

<p>We have added many important features, among them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encrypted attachments</li>
<li>Display HTML mails</li>
<li>Forward, CC, BCC</li>
<li>Support for popular character sets (Umlauts, Chinese, etc.)</li>
<li>Option to manage keys without a passphrase</li>
<li>Option to change your passphrase</li>
<li>Importing your existing key pair</li>
<li>Importing the public keys of contacts using other PGP clients</li>
</ul>

<p>And much more. For details please consult the various <a href="https://github.com/whiteout-io/mail-html5/releases">Release notes</a>.</p>

<h3 id="installing">Installing</h3>

We are already hard at work on apps for iOS and Android, as well as support for popular mail backends like Yahoo Mail, Outlook.com and custom mail server configurations.</p>
