&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming feedback that we received during the campaign showed that there is strong interest in a free product version for Whiteout Mailbox. Users expect to be given a useful version of a product for free in exchange for their commitment to using the product and for referring others to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today we are happy to announce that &lt;strong&gt;we are offering Whiteout Mailbox Personal Edition with 2GB storage for free&lt;/strong&gt;, starting today. The product is still in beta, but you can &lt;a href="https://whiteout.io/#pricing"&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; today, no invite code needed. And tell your friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pro version is under development and will be available later this year. The Whiteout Mail client for use with your existing mailbox is of course also available for free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks again to everybody for your valuable input.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Whiteout Mail 1.0 and Security Audit by Cure53</title><description>&lt;p&gt;As we started closing in on version 1.0, there was one more item on the roadmap: A security audit by a reputable source.

A trusted partner since we started Whiteout Networks, Cure53 from Berlin was the obvious choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cure53 has profound knowledge of web security, giving both high-level conceptual advice, as well as well-crafted proof-of-concept-attacks. This has helped to uncover and fix issues that would have never surfaced otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank them for the fruitful collaboration and their uncompromising stance on security! It was fun to track down the issues and fix them, and we’re proud to say that this ongoing process has helped Whiteout Mail become better in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usability is very dear to us, as good usability directly translates into security. During the audit, Whiteout Mail was not only subjected to attacks, but also inspected for ambiguous messaging for the less tech-savvy user of email encryption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the the high-severity vulnerabilities have been discussed and fixed/mitigated, as well as many of the medium to low severity vulnerabilities. We will continue working on the open issues in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an excerpt from the report’s conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cure53 has followed the Whiteout team over the years, providing thorough security advice and in-depth audit. Keep in mind that the first tests and discussion started in late 2013 and continued fruitfully until this day. Cure53 is therefore in a position to have watched the software grow into the current shape of the long-anticipated version 1.0. In the current state of development, Whiteout has mastered mitigation of a large range of security issues. It has matured to a level, where an attacker can only (if at all) revert to social engineering attacks in hopes of meeting his or her goals. Only minor issues remain capable of causing limited damage to the user-base and their encrypted communications.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Providing a secure yet usable mail encryption software is not an easy task and requires consideration of a multitude of attacks, as well as a well-balanced security defense deployed across many levels. It begins on the lower layers of mail reception, mail body parsing and key management, and then moves all the way to the high up handling of the application stack, where a safe, secure and comprehensible UI is required to ensure that the user makes the right decisions. Over the mentioned time period a close collaboration of the Whiteout team with Cure53 was marked by several code audits, concept reviews, discussions and design considerations. Eventually, the software in scope reached the necessary level of maturity, allowing for it to be labeled a 1.0 version without false pretense or an overly quick jump to the first stable major release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We had a lot of technical discussions on which platform to use for development, but in the end decided to make a bet on the web and also its rate of progression as a foundation for cross-platform app development. This is what the app looks like today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/05/placeit_2.png" alt="Whiteout Mail Screenshots"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision was not obvious at the time given the recent developments from &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/23/3262782/facebook-for-ios-native-app"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/17/linkedin-mobile-web-breakup/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; shifting away from HTML5 to a native apps strategy. And for good reason. &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/01/mobile-app-usage-increases-in-2014-as-mobile-web-surfing-declines/"&gt;Recent data shows&lt;/a&gt; that mobile users are spending more time in apps than on the mobile web. Since many apps are written with web technology it's not clear if this is because of native vs. web. But it’s safe to assume one aspect is that native user interfaces are often perceived as faster and more fluid than their HTML5 counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that fast and fluid user experiences cannot be built using web technology. In fact after Facebook announced its shift to native, Sencha released a proof of concept called &lt;a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/the-making-of-fastbook-an-html5-love-story"&gt;fastbook&lt;/a&gt;, which showed that it is indeed possible to build native like app experiences using nothing but web technology. It was clear that it was cheaper and easier to build a great experience for a single platform using native. But since we wanted Whiteout Mail to run everywhere, we needed a more scalable approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="thebet"&gt;The bet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by fastbook and some other apps and ui frameworks that we had been testing internally for our first proof of concept implementation of Whiteout Mail, we decided to make a bet on HTML5. This bet was based on the following hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evergreen browsers such as Chrome and Firefox are increasing the rate of innovation on the web and these would inevitably lead to evergreen WebViews that are used as runtimes in frameworks such as Cordova.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform and hardware capabilities, that were traditionally only exposed as native apis via Objective C on iOS or Java on Android, would surface as standardized apis for JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development tools and frameworks would improve to the point where you would press only a button and out comes your app for: Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we are excited about Firefox OS. We don't believe it will compete with Android in terms of marketshare anytime soon, but Mozilla has always put pressure on other Browser/OS vendors like Google by spearheading standardization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fastforwardtotoday"&gt;Fast forward to today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aren't quite there yet, but having spent the last year developing for the Chrome Apps platform, I think we're pretty damn close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android 4.4 was released with the Chromium WebView and Android 5.0 now has an &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/about/versions/lollipop.html#WebView"&gt;autoupdating evergreen WebView&lt;/a&gt;. To bridge the gap to older devices and OS versions, developers can use the &lt;a href="https://crosswalk-project.org/"&gt;CrossWalk WebView&lt;/a&gt; to deploy an up-to-date runtime to Android 4.0+ (basically &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html"&gt;over 90%&lt;/a&gt; of the current Android installed base).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has released a very fast WebView for iOS 8. There are still some warts and I won’t go into all the details here. But you can read about the new WKWebView in &lt;a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/apple-shows-love-for-html5-with-ios-8"&gt;Sencha’s post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many apis like &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TCPSocket"&gt;raw TCP sockets&lt;/a&gt; that are required for implementing email protocols like IMAP/SMTP aren’t standardized yet. But there are proprietary apis to fill the gap e.g. &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/sockets_tcp"&gt;chrome.sockets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.networking.sockets.streamsocket.aspx"&gt;StreamSocket&lt;/a&gt;. They can be shimmed easily to work like the emerging standard api using our &lt;a href="https://github.com/whiteout-io/tcp-socket"&gt;tcp-socket shim&lt;/a&gt;. This allowed us to develop &lt;a href="http://emailjs.org"&gt;email.js&lt;/a&gt;, a toolbox for writing cross-platform email applications in pure JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id="whatarechromeapps"&gt;What are Chrome Apps?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who is new to Chrome Apps here are two resources to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official documentation: &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps"&gt;https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great introduction video: &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/f3NctLbtsNE"&gt;http://youtu.be/f3NctLbtsNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id="whywechosechromeapps"&gt;Why we chose Chrome Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reasons for us to use chrome apps are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Security:&lt;/strong&gt; Since Whiteout Mail stores the user's private PGP key locally there are a lot of advantages to Chrome Apps when compared to the normal drive by web. I've written about threat modeling for browser crypto in detail &lt;a href="http://tankredhase.com/2014/04/13/heartbleed-and-javascript-crypto/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Distribution:&lt;/strong&gt; Most users go to their platform’s native app store to discover new apps. Chrome Apps support packaging for all relevant platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac OS, Linux).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Offline:&lt;/strong&gt; Email clients need to work when users are offline. Users want to read and write messages on a train or a flight. The client should sync whenever there’s a connection but also work when there isn’t one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ourexperiencewithchromeapps"&gt;Our Experience with Chrome Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a complete email client in JavaScript with full IMAP / SMTP / MIME / OpenPGP support wasn’t an easy task, but the Chrome Apps platform provided a good foundation for this journey. Here is a brief overview of our experience developing Whiteout Mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="thedesktop"&gt;The desktop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/05/placeit_3.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Whiteout Mail for the desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started on the desktop since that was the first platform Chrome Apps were officially supported. This has turned out to be a good place to start. Chrome Apps are currently the most stable deployment path for cross-platform HTML5 packaged apps. We tried &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Marketplace/Options/Packaged_apps"&gt;Firefox Packaged Apps&lt;/a&gt; but couldn't even &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24339502/how-to-test-privileged-packaged-apps-on-firefox-for-desktop"&gt;debug them&lt;/a&gt; for the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that Chrome Apps have several more constraints than regular web apps like &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/contentSecurityPolicy"&gt;Content Security Policy (CSP)&lt;/a&gt;. You may need to sandbox certain content into iframes and using apis like eval and inline scripts is not allowed. This is one reason we decided to use angular.js as it &lt;a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngCsp"&gt;supports CSP&lt;/a&gt; out of the box. One valuable experience we had here is that starting from a constrained architecture is always easier than the other way around. So it's best to start using CSP early if you intend to support Chrome Apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try our desktop app &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whiteout-mail/jjgghafhamholjigjoghcfcekhkonijg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="android"&gt;Android&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/05/placeit_1.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we ported the app to Android using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/blob/master/README.md"&gt;Chrome Cordova Apps&lt;/a&gt;. This turned out to be a surprisingly simple task due to the above mentioned Crosswalk WebView. The main challenge here was getting the back button for Android to work correctly. To be fair this was mainly because we forgot to handle the browser history at first in angular. Had we done this right from the beginning, the back button would have worked out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try the Android app &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.whiteout.WhiteoutMail"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ios"&gt;iOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we went on to tackle iOS. This turned out to be the hardest of the platforms due to some issues with the Chrome Api plugins. Thankfully &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/MobileChromeApps/people"&gt;the team&lt;/a&gt; behind Mobile Chrome Apps was very helpful and supportive. Anytime we had an issue, we received a response promptly on GitHub. Bugfixes also landed quickly in upcoming versions of &lt;em&gt;cca&lt;/em&gt; (Chrome Cordova Apps’ command line tool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try our iOS app &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whiteout-mail/id934872032"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="theweb"&gt;The Web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were even able to get a full version of the app running on the web using the same code-base as for the Chrome Apps. We did this by extending our tcp-socket shim to use &lt;a href="http://socket.io"&gt;socket.io&lt;/a&gt; (to proxy TCP connections required for IMAP and SMTP) and &lt;a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge"&gt;Forge&lt;/a&gt; (a JavaScript implementation of TLS). This way we were able to terminate the TLS session on the user’s machine so that our proxy does not see any plaintext user data like passwords or email message content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try the webmail version of Whiteout Mail &lt;a href="https://mail.whiteout.io"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="thecode"&gt;The code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’re interested you can check out all of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/whiteout-io/mail-html5"&gt;code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; since the Whiteout Mail client is &lt;a href="https://blog.whiteout.io/2014/10/17/webmail-and-open-source/"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chrome Apps platform is pretty close to the &lt;em&gt;write once run anywhere&lt;/em&gt; dream developers aspire to. The main advantage to using something like Chrome Apps or Cordova is that you can deploy your web app using each platform's native app store, since this is where most users go to discover new content and apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are of course still some caveats e.g. missing standardization of certain apis and packaging formats, but time will fix all of these issues. Standardization always trails innovation and without pioneers like Chrome Apps we would have to iterate on these concepts within the standards bodies, which is in nobody’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a feeling for where all this is heading here’s a &lt;a href="https://divshot.com/blog/opinion/the-future-of-the-web-according-to-google/"&gt;great summary&lt;/a&gt; of the 2014 Chrome Developer Summit. It seems like Google will be focusing less on proprietary apis in Chrome Apps and more on bringing all of this goodness to the open web. They intend to keep supporting Chrome Apps since it’s the native development platform for Chromebooks but it's clear where the focus will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does all of this mean for developers? In short I would definitely recommend developing for Chrome Apps. Even if Google decided to deprecate Chrome Apps tomorrow, you could still reuse 99% of your code on the open web (as we have with the Webmail version of Whiteout Mail). So there’s not a lot of risk for vendor lock-in. All in all Chrome Apps have become a very robust development environment and tooling like remote debugging in Chrome has matured to a point that the web now has a productive development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Whiteout Mail Available For iOS.</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Today we have some exciting news to share: The Whiteout Mail client now available for iOS.

So you can send and receive encrypted email on all your devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Integrated PGP-client for iOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact Whiteout Mail is the first wholly-integrated PGP-client for iOS, where a single app lets users read and write encrypted emails and communicate with other PGP users. And with full IMAP support it connects to any existing mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application has a fully responsive design, runs on every size display and adapts to the available screen real estate, with optimized layouts for smartphone and tablet form factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/05/unnamed.png" alt="alt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure Key Synchronization Across All Devices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Whiteout’s secure key synchronization users can send and receive PGP-encrypted messages on all their devices, desktop, tablet smartphone, iOS, Android, even Chromebooks. And with automatic recipient key lookup, encrypting and signing your email is completely painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thank you to the large number of beta testers who braved the Testflight installation procedure and gave us a lot of important feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

In the previous post we discussed that in today’s multi screen world it is mandatory to be able to read and write encrypted messages on several devices at once. In this context we proposed a specification for encrypted key synchronization. This post will once again highlight this topic by introducing a new simplified version of the specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="specificationupdateanrfc"&gt;Specification Update - an RFC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new spec is published in our GitHub wiki and our intent is to publish this as an RFC for standardization, as other OpenPGP user agents such as Enigmail have expressed interest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/whiteout-io/mail-html5/wiki/Secure-OpenPGP-Key-Pair-Synchronization-via-IMAP"&gt;Secure OpenPGP Key Pair Synchronization via IMAP (RFC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the new spec is much simpler than our initial proposal. The encrypted private key is no longer stored on our server, but rather just stored in the user’s IMAP server. This not only removes the need to add a proprietary authentication mechanism, since IMAP servers already provide password (as well as 2-factor) based authentication, it also reduces the complexity of the overall protocol. This reduces the attack surface since a simpler protocol is easier to reason about, audit, and implement correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="userexperience"&gt;User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user experience has also been simplified. The user no longer needs to be logged into another mail client to receive the recovery token required for authentication. The user simply needs to have an active IMAP session open, which is the case anyway for Whiteout Mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="upload"&gt;Upload&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key sync is now mandatory and the first time a user sets up Whiteout Mail they are prompted to write down a backup code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/04/upload-1.png" alt="Write down backup code"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are then prompted to confirm the backup code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/04/upload-2.png" alt="Confirm backup code"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the user’s key pair is backed up in case they lose their device or in case they want to sync to a new device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="download"&gt;Download&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a new device, the user simply logs into Whiteout Mail with their email address. The app will automatically detect a synced key and will prompt the user to enter the backup code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/04/download.png" alt="Enter backup code"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And done! It’s that easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tryitnow"&gt;Try it now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try out the new key sync, just head on over to our &lt;a href="https://whiteout.io/#product"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; and install the app for your platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="acknowledgements"&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;

That's why we've been working hard over the last few months to rebuild the Whiteout Mail experience from the ground up. Today we're excited to share what we've come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="thenewdesktop"&gt;The New Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/02/placeit_3-3.jpg" alt="New Desktop Layout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Whiteout Mail client is designed to run on all your devices, desktop, tablets, smartphones. We have now added an additional layout to our responsive design that is optimized for the larger screen you typically have on a desktop or laptop computer. You will recognize the familiar layout displaying all your folders in the lefthand pane from the desktop mail clients you normally use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="completelyresponsive"&gt;Completely Responsive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/02/placeit_2-4.png" alt="Responsive Design"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you resize the window it will automatically adopt the layouts for the tablet or the smartphone screen sizes. The new desktop layout is available both in the packaged app as well as in the webmail version of Whiteout Mail. To try it out just head over to &lt;a href="https://mail.whiteout.io"&gt;mail.whiteout.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="standardsbasedandopensource"&gt;Standards based and Open Source&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the user interface changed, the core of our application remains the same. We are committed to building on established open standards such as OpenPGP, IMAP and SMTP. This means you can use the new client with your existing email account and write PGP messages to non-whiteout users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always the source code is open. &lt;a href="https://github.com/whiteout-io/mail-html5"&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="advancenoticewhiteoutmailboxprivatebeta"&gt;Advance Notice: Whiteout Mailbox Private Beta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working on Whiteout Mailbox, a new email service that will be available as an additional secure mailbox for your confidential communication needs. Or as your new mailbox where you send and receive all your mail. Whiteout Mailbox is hosted in Germany and will offer important security benefits, especially at-rest encryption of your messages when they are stored in the cloud. Let us know if you want to take part in the upcoming private beta at &lt;a href="mailto:support@whiteout.io"&gt;support@whiteout.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Webmail &amp; Open Source</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/02/Bildschirmfoto-2014-10-13-um-16-56-46-3.png" alt="Whiteout Mail is now available for the web!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have big plans for Whiteout Mail and today we'd like to share a few more pieces of the puzzle: Placing the mail client under the MIT open source license to encourage community participation, announcing support for trusted web hosting, and a preview of the premium services that we are working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="opensourcelicense"&gt;Open Source License&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to announce that starting today, the complete Whiteout Mail client will be put under the MIT open source license. Our client code has been &lt;a href="https://github.com/whiteout-io/mail-html5"&gt;open for inspection&lt;/a&gt; from day one, but the MIT license will allow us to build Whiteout Mail together with a very diverse open source community. We welcome non-profit contributors as well as commercial partners at every level of the stack. This is why we are very excited to see that Mozilla is using our &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=885110"&gt;email.js libraries in the Firefox OS 2.1 mail client&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope Whiteout Mail will become for multi-device PGP and the Web what Thunderbird is for the desktop and we look forward to your contributions and ideas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="trustedwebhosting"&gt;Trusted Webhosting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand that different users may have different threat models in mind when selecting a solution for encrypted email. This is why starting today we will support Whiteout for three levels of trust:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="1packagedappinstallation"&gt;1. Packaged App Installation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the default and most secure mode. We provide official builds for Chrome, Android and iOS (coming soon). There is no need to trust us when using these apps, as they are installed as signed apps from an App Store and the installed source code can be compared with our tagged releases on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="2trustedwebhosting"&gt;2. Trusted Webhosting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting today, you will be able to download and install WM to your own trusted web server and use it in the browser. Use cases could include your company's server or setting up your own self-hosted solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool thing is that the IMAP/SMTP logic is still implemented completely in js on the client. TCP traffic is proxied with the TLS session terminated in the user's browser using socket.io and js-crypto (&lt;a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;). This means that the proxy on the webserver will see only encrypted traffic and never any user data like IMAP/SMTP passwords or message contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the packaged app, user data such as your private PGP key, are persisted only on the client (in IndexedDB), and the app's code is even cached for offline use (using HTML5 AppCache). The Application can be installed to the device’s homescreen and is configured to notify the user when the AppCache is updated. This makes the user experience as transparent as possible and works similarly to updates via an App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since users are getting the js crypto code from the web server, there will be a trust relationship to that server. But if this is your own trusted server this is ok. The web server enforces CSP (Content Security Policy) and HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to mitigate cross site scripting and man-in-the-middle attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="3managedwebmail"&gt;3. Managed Webmail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third mode of operation is managed hosting by us. Due to the TLS connection from the browser to the IMAP server, our proxy will never see any of your data. But you will be trusting the Whiteout webserver to deliver the correct code to your browser in this mode. The threat model for this approach is discussed &lt;a href="https://blog.whiteout.io/2014/04/13/heartbleed-and-javascript-crypto/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and we will do our best to inform users in plain english about the security trade-off they are making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that this mode of operation does not protect users against active attacks from Whiteout Networks, e.g. should we receive a subpoena for a specific user. But it will protect users against passive attacks, like dragnet surveillance and wiretapping of government agencies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think it's important that users are able to make an informed decision about how much convenience they want to give up for security. If you're a concerned citizen and don't want too much hassle to protect your email privacy, this might be the right mode for you. Just open your favorite web browser and navigate to  &lt;a href="https://mail.whiteout.io"&gt;mail.whiteout.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="premiumservices"&gt;Premium Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the WM client is completely free and open source, we will offer paid options for power users and companies in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fullyencryptedwhiteoutmailbox"&gt;Fully encrypted Whiteout Mailbox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will offer paid mailboxes under the wmail.io domain. This is a fully managed mailbox with extra privacy features built in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon uploading your public PGP key to our key-server, all incoming messages will be encrypted on the fly to your public key before being stored on our servers (hosted in Europe). Also: unlike free mail providers like Gmail, we will not log user data or scan your emails to show you advertising. With Whiteout you are the customer, not the product!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Messages stored in wmail.io will only be accessible with the private PGP key, stored on your device. This will protect your messages at rest on the server against hackers and identity theft. You will even be able to use other mail clients with wmail.io (like Apple Mail together with GPGtools or Thunderbird with Enigmail).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember: your email address is your identity on the internet and now you can protect it with an extra layer of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect to hear more about how to sign up for early access to the Whiteout Mailbox private beta program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="premiumservicesandvolumelicensing"&gt;Premium Services and Volume Licensing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Whiteout Mail client is free. Users who want to get the best possible experience will be able to select a paid premium service, which includes automatic updates, secure key synchronization for multiple devices, as well as a support hotline. Organizations who are interested in deploying encrypted email across larger groups of users will benefit from our volume licensing program. Watch this space for further updates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy encrypting!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>IMAP and Android</title><description>&lt;p&gt;At Whiteout Networks we have been busy improving the Whiteout Mail client. We have just published an update and wanted to let you know what we have been working on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="betterimapsupport"&gt;Better IMAP Support&lt;/h2&gt;

We have just published an update and wanted to let you know what we have been working on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="betterimapsupport"&gt;Better IMAP Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Whiteout Mail previously only worked with Gmail, you can now connect additional email servers, both well-known servers such as Yahoo or T-Online, as well as your own IMAP server with a custom configuration. So now you can use end-to-end encryption with many more recipients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/02/Bildschirmfoto-2014-07-24-um-17-53-10.png" alt="Choose from one of your favorite mail providers."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="androidappnowinalpha"&gt;Android App Now in Alpha&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have completed the first version of the Android implementation. This is now available as an Alpha version in the Google Play Store. Click &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.whiteout.WhiteoutMail"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.whiteout.io/content/images/2015/02/Mail-list-Nexus-5-2.png" alt="Android App now available!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already use Whiteout Mail on your desktop, please note that you will need to use the experimental "Key sync" functionality to store your encrypted key pair in our cloud. When you install the Android app you will be able to synchronize the key pair onto your Android device. See &lt;a href="https://blog.whiteout.io/2014/07/07/secure-pgp-key-sync-a-proposal"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more details on the Key sync service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="performanceimprovements"&gt;Performance Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added significant performance improvements for handling larger mailboxes with thousands of messages. These are especially noticeable on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pgpinteroperability"&gt;PGP Interoperability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the number one request from our beta users. Some people already have an existing keypair that they want to reuse while others have contacts who already use PGP that they want to communicate with. With the new release you now can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;import your existing private key when installing the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;get the public key for a contact and import that (under “Contacts”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
